A basic Network Sniffer Script Written in Python to understand network traffic and data flow @Rhombix technologies


  _This project successfully demonstrates how to build a basic yet powerful network sniffer in Python. 
  It highlights critical network concepts such as Ethernet framing and IPv4 headers. Additionally, it shows how to manage platform-specific privilege requirements.
  The project can be further extended with protocol filtering, GUI display, logging capabilities, or even exporting to PCAP format for use in tools like Wireshark.
